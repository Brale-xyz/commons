# Brale Commons

A collection of standardized formats, reference implementations, and resources to help developers build faster with stablecoins.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains:

- **Commons Stablecoin Format (CSF)**
  - `csf.json` - Definition file for the Commons Stablecoin Format standard (v1.4.2)
  - `README.md` - Documentation for the Commons Stablecoin Format

- **Funds Flows**
  - `Basic Business Stablecoin Payout Funds Flow` - Reference implementation for business payout flows

- **Resources**
  - `TransferType_ValueType.json` - Standard definitions for transfer and value types

## Commons Stablecoin Format

The Commons Stablecoin Format (CSF) provides a standardized way to document funds flows in stablecoin and blockchain systems. CSF ensures correct handling of:
- All transaction types
- Error handling
- Exchange processing
- Timing considerations
- Explicit transfers

CSF uses Mermaid sequence diagrams with a swimlane architecture and supports three complexity levels (Light, Medium, and Heavy) to accommodate different documentation needs.

## Funds Flows

Reference implementations for common stablecoin funds flows, designed to accelerate implementation of standard business processes using the CSF specification.

## Resources

Supplementary resources to support stablecoin implementations, including type definitions and reference data that complement the CSF standard.

## Getting Started

Browse the repository folders to find relevant resources for your implementation. Each section contains specific documentation for its components.
